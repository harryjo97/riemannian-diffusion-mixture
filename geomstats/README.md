In our work, we use ``geomstats`` with jax functionality added.
This specific implementation is built upon the following repo: https://github.com/oxcsml/riemannian-score-sde

We would sincerely appreciate citations to both the original research paper and the software version, to acknowledge authors who started the codebase and made the library possible, together with the crucial work of all contributors who are continuously implementing pivotal new geometries and important learning algorithms, as well as refactoring, testing and documenting the code to democratize geometric statistics and (deep) learning and foster reproducible research in this field.
